# WordCount
CS 570 - Operating Systems 

A simple word count that implements an ASCII progress bar. This program demonstrates the use of POSIX threads in order to count the number of words without blocking the main thread while the progress bar shows the status of the number of the words being counted with respect to the entire file size on another thread.
